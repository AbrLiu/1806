Students in 18.06 have the option of using <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e1ae5c7f6fe275a50134d5889a68f0acdd09ada8/687474703a2f2f6a756c69616c616e672e6f72672f696d616765732f6c6f676f5f68697265732e706e67" width="33" align=top> through the  [juliabox.org](https://juliabox.org) website.

** Julia problem set 4 is already out! Replace `PS3`in the instructions below with `PS4`to get it! Deadline for problem set 3 is Friday 9th October.**

## Instructions for Problem Set 3

0. The Julia option (only!)  may be completed by midnight Friday night for full credit (12:01AM Saturday to be precise)
1. Login to [juliabox.org](https://juliabox.org) with your google account. <br> <img  src="http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/julia-juliabox.jpg" width="300" >
2. If you did pset 1, go back into pset1 (or a new notebook) and copy and paste the next line:<br> `download("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanedelman/18.06_Spring_2015/master/18.06-PS3.ipynb", "18.06-PS3.ipynb" )`
<br> in a new cell  and execute
4. Go back to the notebooks tab (or hit the IJ icon), refresh, and enjoy pset 2
3. If you filled in your gmail and mit address once this semester, it is not necessary to do again.
4. If you are trying julia for the first time, open up a new notebook (any kernel is fine) and follow the instruction on line 3


### Some Notes:

1. If you do both MITx and Julia problem sets, we will take a simple maximum of the two total scores each week. 
2. Scores for MITx or Julia may be posted at different times (probably 24 or 48 hours apart)
3. The MITx and Julia problems are nearly identical, though there are some minor changes due to format and language.  We hope the Julia set is more fun.
4. Ask Julia questions through Piazza and very likely Professor Edelman will answer them quickly
6. Don't worry if something technically goes wrong.  We can always do things manually, just send  a friendly note through piazza or to edelman at mit.edu.
7. If you need to re-download the notebook to get some fixes you can run `download("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanedelman/18.06_Spring_2015/master/18.06-PS3.ipynb", "18.06-PS3_new_version.ipynb" )` (notice the changed name as the second argument to `download`. Now you can open the new notebook and you *only need to answer the problems you haven't already or had trouble with*. Your score from the previous notebook will be saved.

Students in 18.06 have the option of using <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e1ae5c7f6fe275a50134d5889a68f0acdd09ada8/687474703a2f2f6a756c69616c616e672e6f72672f696d616765732f6c6f676f5f68697265732e706e67" width="40"> through the  [juliabox.org](https://juliabox.org) website.

## Instructions 

1. Go to [juliabox.org](https://juliabox.org).
2. Click on the Sync tab (on top). (If by chance it fails to load, try hitting refresh in the browser.)
3. Paste `https://github.com/alanedelman/18.06_Spring_2015.git` under "Git Clone URL". <br> Then click on the "+" button under Action.
4. Click on the IJulia tab (on top), refresh (upper right icon), and click on `18.06_Spring_`
5. The first cell is a bit ugly, but if you hit Shift+Enter it will ask for your @mit login name.  This is how we know who you are.
6. Enter your answers with Shift+Enter.  Have fun with Julia!

### Some Notes:

1. If you do both MITx and Julia problem sets, we will take a simple maximum of the two total scores each week. 
2. Scores for MITx or Julia may be posted at different times (probably 24 or 48 hours apart)
3. The MITx and Julia problems are nearly identical, though there are some minor changes due to format and language.  We hope the Julia set is more fun.
4. Ask Julia questions through Piazza and very likely Professor Edelman will answer them quickly
6. Don't worry if something technically goes wrong.  We can always do things manually, just send  a friendly note to edelman at mit.edu.

Students in 18.06 have the option of using <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e1ae5c7f6fe275a50134d5889a68f0acdd09ada8/687474703a2f2f6a756c69616c616e672e6f72672f696d616765732f6c6f676f5f68697265732e706e67" width="33" align=top> through the  [juliabox.org](https://juliabox.org) website.

## Instructions for Problem Set 2 


1. Login to [juliabox.org](https://juliabox.org) with your google account. <br> <img  src="http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/julia-juliabox.jpg" width="300" >
2. If you did pset 1, go back into pset1 and copy and paste the next line:<br>
 `download("https://github.com/alanedelman/18.06_Spring_2015/blob/master/18.06-PS2.ipynb")`
` <br> in a new cell in pset1 and execute
3. Go back to the notebooks tab (or hit the IJ icon), refresh, and enjoy pset 2
4. If you are trying julia for the first time, open up a new notebook (any kernel is fine) and follow the instruction on line 2


### Some Notes:

1. If you do both MITx and Julia problem sets, we will take a simple maximum of the two total scores each week. 
2. Scores for MITx or Julia may be posted at different times (probably 24 or 48 hours apart)
3. The MITx and Julia problems are nearly identical, though there are some minor changes due to format and language.  We hope the Julia set is more fun.
4. Ask Julia questions through Piazza and very likely Professor Edelman will answer them quickly
6. Don't worry if something technically goes wrong.  We can always do things manually, just send  a friendly note through piazza or to edelman at mit.edu.

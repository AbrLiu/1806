Students in 18.06 have the option of using <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e1ae5c7f6fe275a50134d5889a68f0acdd09ada8/687474703a2f2f6a756c69616c616e672e6f72672f696d616765732f6c6f676f5f68697265732e706e67" width="33" align=top> through the  [juliabox.org](https://juliabox.org) website.

## Instructions 


1. Login to [juliabox.org](https://juliabox.org) with your google account. <br> <img  src="http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/julia-juliabox.jpg" width="300" >
2. Click on the Console tab
3. Copy and paste `wget https://github.com/alanedelman/18.06_Spring_2015/blob/master/18.06-PS2.ipynb`
4. Sometimes paste doesn't work.  You can right click on the console, paste from browser, paste, ok, (maybe click on console), and hit return
4. Click on the IJulia tab (on top), refresh (upper right icon), and click on `18.06_Spring_`
5. The first cell is a bit ugly, but if you hit Shift+Enter it will ask for your @mit login name.  This is how we know who you are.  (If by chance nothing happens after a minute, try hitting Shift+Enter again.)
6. Enter your answers with Shift+Enter.  Have fun with Julia!

### Some Notes:

1. If you do both MITx and Julia problem sets, we will take a simple maximum of the two total scores each week. 
2. Scores for MITx or Julia may be posted at different times (probably 24 or 48 hours apart)
3. The MITx and Julia problems are nearly identical, though there are some minor changes due to format and language.  We hope the Julia set is more fun.
4. Ask Julia questions through Piazza and very likely Professor Edelman will answer them quickly
6. Don't worry if something technically goes wrong.  We can always do things manually, just send  a friendly note through piazza or to edelman at mit.edu.
